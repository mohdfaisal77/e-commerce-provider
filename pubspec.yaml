# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/images/common/images/
     - assets/images/common/images/profile/profile_img.png
     - assets/images/common/images/women_images/clothes.png
     - assets/images/common/images/women_images/photo.png
     - assets/images/common/images/women_images/new.png
     - assets/images/common/images/women_images/accesories.png
     - assets/images/common/images/women_images/shoes.png
     - assets/images/common/icons/
     - assets/images/common/logos/
     - assets/images/utils/
     - assets/images/common/icons/back_arrow.png
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom app_color to your application, add a app_color section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "app_color" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # app_color:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     app_color:
  #       - asset: app_color/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: app_color/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     app_color:
  #       - asset: app_color/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: app_color/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding app_color from package dependencies,
